    <h2 class="css-questions">How to Apply CSS to HTML</h2>
    <p class="css-questions">
        To add css to html externally, you first need to have a CSS document. You need to reference the CSS document in the html document that you want to edit. This can be done by using href attribute in the link element <br>
        In the CSS file, you use a selector to chose which html element you want to modify. You could do this by choosing all the element or by using specific selector such as class or id.  
        <br> example of a CSS file <br>
        <code>
            p { <br>
                color: red; <br>
            }
        </code> <br> <br>
        The p means that this CSS code is selecting all paragraph, everything under the brackets meant the attribute that it is changing. In this case, it changing the text color to red.
    </p>

    <h2 class="js-questions">How to Use JavaScript in a Webpage</h2>
    <p class="js-questions">
        The first option,we could add use JavaScript by writing it in a seperate file, to do this we need to link the JavaScript file to the html. We can do this by adding this in the head of the html file <br>
        <code>
            script src="path/to/my/script.js">script
        </code>
        <br>
        after that we can write any code we want in the javascript file <br>
        The second option is to write the JavaScript code directly in the html file. You can do this by writing the JavaScript inside the script element. <br>
        for example: <br>
        <code>
            script> <br>
                window.addEventListener("load", () => { <br>
                  console.log("This function is executed once the page is fully loaded"); <br>
                }); <br>
              /script> <br>
              
        </code>

    </p>
